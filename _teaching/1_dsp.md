## Course Description

This course explores the principles and techniques of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) beyond the one-dimensional case, extending into two and higher dimensions. Key topics include:

- Differences and similarities between 1D and multidimensional DSP
- Fundamentals of two-dimensional signals and systems
- Sampling techniques for spatio-temporal signals
- Design and analysis of 2D and multidimensional filters
- Linear block transforms and filterbank transforms
- Lifting schemes and geometric wavelets
- Solving inverse problems for multidimensional signals
- Applications of DSP in media processing
- The course provides both theoretical foundations and practical insights, making it ideal for those interested in advanced signal processing techniques for images, videos, and other multidimensional data.
