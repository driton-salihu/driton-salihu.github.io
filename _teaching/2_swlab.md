## Acknowledgment

The course was designed and is held by [Dr. Markus Hofbauer](https://hofbi.github.io/).

## Course Description

Basic introduction to principles of software engineering including unit testing, test driven development, refactoring, CI, and automation.

Software engineering skills of any engineer become more important with the ongoing digitization and automation. Software engineering means not only delivering an implementation that fulfills the requirements and generates correct results. A second highly important aspect is to deliver software that can be maintained by multiple contributors, over months, years or even decades. This lifetime aspect and the number of developers contributing to the software introduces additional requirements and challenges in the development process. Software has to be testable, readable, and extendable. Concepts such as unit tests, code reviews, and continuous integration support writing software with these characteristics.
