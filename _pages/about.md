Hey! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Chair of Media Technology](https://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, advised by [Prof. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/en/people/prof-dr-ing-eckehard-steinbach/), currently working on [6G-life](https://6g-life.de/) project.

I have completed my Master’s degree in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.
While conducting my degree I participated in many different projects.
For my Master Thesis I was supervised by [Dr. Christoph Bachhuber](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=idP3uZMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/en/people/prof-dr-ing-eckehard-steinbach/), where I worked on modern Illumination Estimation for Augmented Reality. 
I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Walter Stechele](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/lis/stechele/), [Dr. Nael Fasfous](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x9wjapMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr. Manoj Rohit Vemparala](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WDNeaMoAAAAJ) over the whole duration of my Master's exploring the intricate nature of Quantization and Pruning in Deep Neural Networks.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, supervised by [Prof. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.lmt.ei.tum.de/en/people/prof-dr-ing-eckehard-steinbach/) and [Dr. Rania Hassen](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ZXqOM0UAAAAJ&hl=en).

While working on to obtain my degrees I was able to obtain practical experiences at companies such BMW Group, Nokia, and Bertrandt (formerly Philotech GmbH).

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with a particular focus on 3D vision and its applications as well as efficient AI (with a particular focus on quantization and pruning).
I am currently working on 3D scene reconstruction (from images and/or point clouds), 3D pose estimation, 3D retrieval and representation learning.

Outside of research, I have a deep interest in tennis, reading, and baking. Hit me up if you want to play against each other!

I am currently looking for research opportunities outside of university so feel free to reach out via email!
